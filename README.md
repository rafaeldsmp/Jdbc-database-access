# Project Description

This project uses MySQL Workbench as the database design tool and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) in conjunction with `mysql-connector-j-8.1.0.jar` to create an interactive Java application that connects to a MySQL database. The main objective is to develop a robust and efficient system for data storage and retrieval.

## Implemented Features

- **Database Connection:** Establishes a secure connection to the MySQL database using JDBC and the `mysql-connector-j-8.1.0.jar` driver.  
- **CRUD Operations:** Implements basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to interact with the database tables. Users can add new records, view existing information, update data, and delete records as needed.
- **Integration with MySQL Workbench:** Utilizes MySQL Workbench for data modeling, database schema, and SQL query optimization to ensure the operational efficiency of the database.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:** git clone https://github.com/rafaeldsmp/jdbc-database-access.git
2. **Information about user, password and database are on file db.properties.

## Technologies Used
- **MySQL Workbench:** Database design tool for visually modeling and managing database schemas.  
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):** Java API that allows interaction with relational databases, in this case, MySQL.
- **mysql-connector-j-8.1.0.jar:** Official MySQL JDBC driver for Java, used to establish the connection between the Java application and the MySQL database.
